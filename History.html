When India gained its independence in 1947, the British province of Punjab was split between the new sovereign states of India and Pakistan, and the smaller, eastern portion became part of India. </p>

<div class="col-lg-12"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p class="data"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter independence, the history of the Indian Punjab was dominated by Sikh agitation for a separate Punjabi-speaking state, led by Tara Singh and later by his political successor, Sant Fateh Singh. In November 1956, however, rather than being divided along linguistic lines, the Indian state of Punjab was enlarged through incorporation of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), an amalgamation of the preindependence princely territories of Patiala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Kapurthala, Kalsia, Malerkotla (Maler Kotla), and Nalagarh. Political and administrative leadership for the enlarged Punjab was provided by Sardar Partap Singh Kairon, chief minister of the state from 1956 to 1964. The call for a separate Indian state containing the predominantly Punjabi-speaking areas intensified in the wake of Punjab’s expansion. Eventually, the government of India met the demand. On November 1, 1966, Punjab was divided on the basis of language into the mostly Hindi-speaking state of Haryana and the new, primarily Punjabi-speaking state of Punjab; meanwhile, the northernmost districts were transferred to Himachal Pradesh, and the newly constructed city of Chandigarh and its immediate surroundings became a separate union territory. Though not a part of either state, the city of Chandigarh was retained as the joint administrative headquarters, or capital, of both Haryana and Punjab.</p>

<div class="col-lg-12"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<p class="data"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlthough Sikhs had won the use of Punjabi within the state, by the 1980s militant factions of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Supreme Akali Party) and the All India Sikh Students’ Federation were demanding the establishment of an autonomous Sikh homeland, or Khalistan (“Land of the Pure,” a term introduced as early as 1946 by Tara Singh). In order to attain their goal, those groups began to use terrorism, including the indiscriminate killing of Punjabi Hindus and even those Sikhs who opposed the creation of Khalistan. In June 1984, in an effort to dislodge Sikh militants fortified in the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple (the Sikhs’ holiest shrine), the Indian army carried out an attack. The Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and most of his armed followers were killed, as were at least 100 Indian soldiers. In retaliation, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated at her Delhi home by two of her Sikh bodyguards, which in turn led to violence against Sikhs in Delhi and elsewhere. A climate of violence and disorder persisted in Punjab through the 1980s, but by the early 1990s the state had returned to relative stability. The general peace there continued into the early 21st century, helped by the naming of Manmohan Singh, a Sikh, as the prime minister of India in 2004.</p>
